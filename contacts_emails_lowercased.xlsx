We appreciate your interest in the Surf House & FlowRider concept. We would like to provide you in the attached PDF some more details about our concept. In summary, we are actively seeking opportunities in the United States where property owners recognize the value of our concept, which includes not only the lease but also the significant media coverage and increased footfall it brings to the property or destination. To bring the Surf House & FlowRider experience to life, we would require investments from the property owner, ranging from $2 million for outdoor venues to $3-4 million for indoor venues. The investment opportunity can encompass a combination of tenant improvements and lease incentives, such as offering free rent periods. In return, we are committed to becoming a long-term tenant and paying lease to ensure a healthy return on investment. If this model aligns with your goals, we would love to schedule a Zoom meeting with our CEO Janne Miikkulainen (cc:d in this email) to further discuss potential destinations and delve into the business model in greater detail.",

They currently occupy about 6,000 SF which they have outgrown. We are seeking 8-12,000 SF depending on layout to accommodate for the extra space that is needed now and to have the flexibility for future expansion down the line. That being said, does the North Queens Medical Center have any available space this size for such a use. TCI operations account for 30-60 students per day in morning, afternoon and evening sessions. They would require a build-out to include a desired wish list, which I have attached to this email for your review. The building they are currently in at 30-50 Whitestone Expressway, Suite 400, Flushing, NY 11354 is owned by Alma Realty Corp and the lease we did back in 2013 included a full build-out. I emphasize this because construction is not TCI's area of expertise and the experience of a professional landlord would be critical. Also, based on NYS requirements the location for its operations must be in Queens and there must be windows for the classrooms - we can not get approved basement/lower level spaces without windows. Parking and mass transit is important. ",
